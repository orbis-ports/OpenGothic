// A real Tempest sound backend on sceAudioOut, linked into the PS4 build of OpenGothic.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------ what the hardware said
//
// Every number below is from a standalone audio probe on the console, run twice identically.
// Nothing here is inferred from a header or from another platform's driver.
//
//   * THE MAIN PORT IS 48000 Hz AND NOTHING ELSE. 44100, 32000, 24000, 22050, 16000, 12000, 11025 and
//     8000 all return 0x80260008. Gothic's own assets are 22050, 44100, 11025 and (two files) 43344,
//     so EVERY voice is resampled here. That is not an optimisation deferred to later - it is on the
//     path of the first sample that plays.
//   * GRAIN IS A MULTIPLE OF 256, 256..2048. 128 and 300 return 0x80260006 - a different code from a
//     bad rate, so a refusal names which parameter was wrong.
//   * sceAudioOutOutput IS THE CLOCK. 64 calls at grain 256 measured min 5255, mean 5332, max 5425 us
//     against 5333 us of audio in a block: 0.02% off theory. So this file has NO clock, no deadline
//     scheduler and no drift correction - the hardware paces the thread. It also means the call BLOCKS,
//     which is why the mix runs on its own thread and can never be called from the render thread.
//   * ALL FOUR FORMATS OPEN, float included. This uses S16_STEREO anyway: that is the format the demo's
//     audible half actually validated by ear, and the float range is stated nowhere. A verified path
//     beats a shorter unverified one.
//   * THERE IS ONE PORT. Every Open in all three ladders returned the same handle, 0x20000007, for
//     every rate, grain and format and after every Close. That is the id of the main port, not an
//     allocation - so a process gets one output stream.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------ what the one port implies
//
// OpenGothic constructs THREE SoundDevice objects before Application::exec() - Resources::sound,
// Gothic::sndDev and GameMusic::device. If each opened the port they would all hold 0x20000007 and
// fight over it. So the mixer is a process-wide singleton that every SoundDevice shares, and all
// mixing happens in software before that single stream.
//
// It also means GLOBAL VOLUME CANNOT BE PROCESS-WIDE. Gothic has separate music and effect volumes and
// sets them through setGlobalVolume on DIFFERENT devices, so each device owns a gain and every voice
// remembers which device created it. A single global would make the music slider control gunshots.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------ what Gothic actually ships
//
// Measured by scanning the retail archives rather than assumed (Data/Sounds.vdf, Data/Speech1.vdf):
//
//   Sounds.vdf   968 files, 100% PCM 16-bit: 22050 mono (615), 44100 mono (182), 22050 stereo (73),
//                11025 mono (52), 11025 stereo (38), 44100 stereo (6), 43344 mono (2)
//   Speech1.vdf  6000 files scanned, 100% IMA-ADPCM, 4-bit, mono, 44100 Hz
//
// So 8-bit PCM never appears and is still handled (it costs four lines), OGG never appears and is
// refused by name, and ADPCM is not optional: it is every spoken line in the game.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------ what this is NOT, yet
//
// Distance attenuation is a linear rolloff to zero at maxDistance, not OpenAL's inverse-distance
// model, and panning is a constant-power pan from the listener's right vector. Both are stated here
// because they are audible choices a person can judge and change, not physics. There is no doppler, no
// cone, no reverb and no per-voice pitch - nothing in this interface exposes them.
// ⚠ THE PUBLIC SPELLING, and it used to be a relative path that outlived its file. These three
// were `#include "../../Engine/sound/sound*.h"` - correct when this file lived at
// lib/Tempest/ps4/opengothic/, where ../.. IS the Tempest root. From OpenGothic/ps4/ that path
// points one level ABOVE the repository and does not exist; it kept resolving only because the
// quoted-include fallback found it under -I<root>/lib/Tempest/Engine/include, which happens to
// sit exactly two levels below lib/Tempest. Tempest moving its public include directory would
// have broken all six lines with "file not found" and no hint that a file move was the cause.
//
// <Tempest/SoundDevice> and its two neighbours are one-line forwards to the same headers, so
// this is the same code through the interface Tempest actually exports.
